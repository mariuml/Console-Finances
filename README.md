# Console-Finances
Using Javascript to analyse an array of finances data. 

## Description

For this project, I learnt how to apply Javascript logic to solve a 'real world' problem of analysing an array of finances. I used pseudocoding by hand and in comments to help me breakdown the problem into its constituent code. This was a really useful technique of breaking down large problems into more manageable parts.

I applied my knowledge of indexing arrays, creating variables, writing for loops, if statements and Javascript methods to get to the correct result.


## Usage

To access the results, navigate to the developer tools and open up the console. The final analysis will be printed there.
